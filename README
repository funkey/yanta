  Skia
  ----

    To use the version provided by yanta, you don't have to do anything. It
    will be checked out automatically and compiled.

    You can, however, compile skia on your own. In this case, set the
    SKIA_BUILD_DIR cmake variable to the directory you compiled skia in. Run

      $ ./tools/merge_static_libs.py out/Release/libskia.a out/Release/obj.target/**/*.a

    in the skia build directory to generate a single static library for yanta
    to use.

  Compile
  -------

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
